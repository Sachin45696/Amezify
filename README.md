I created an Amazon clone using HTML and CSS, replicating the popular e-commerce platform's user interface. 
This project mimics the layout and design of Amazon's homepage, featuring product listings, navigation menus, and a search bar. 
Through HTML, I structured the web page, while CSS was utilized for styling elements and achieving visual consistency. 
The Amazon clone project demonstrates my ability to develop a responsive and visually appealing web application, showcasing products and offering users a familiar shopping experience.
